# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initializing the gcp-data-platform-demo project structure and memory bank. Establishing foundation for GCP data platform demonstrations.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure
- Initialized project brief and product context
- Set up project documentation framework

## Next Steps
- Define technical stack and GCP services to demonstrate
- Create initial data pipeline examples
- Establish deployment and testing infrastructure
- Add comprehensive documentation

## Active Decisions
- Focus on core GCP data services: BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Dataflow, Pub/Sub
- Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) for resource provisioning
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
- Follow Google Cloud best practices and Well-Architected Framework

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Use Python for data processing scripts
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Docker for containerized deployments
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
- Clear separation between infrastructure, application, and documentation code

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Memory bank approach ensures consistent project understanding
- Early establishment of project structure prevents future refactoring
- GCP data platform requires careful consideration of data lifecycle management
- Cost optimization should be built into architecture from the beginning
