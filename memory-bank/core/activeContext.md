# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Successfully completed infrastructure setup and project organization improvements. Ready to proceed with Phase 2 data pipeline implementations.

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Completed Phase 1: Core Infrastructure implementation
- ✅ Integrated UV and Ruff for dependency management and code quality
- ✅ Refactored `src/` directory into modular Python packages
- ✅ Updated project documentation with comprehensive README
- ✅ Established Google Cloud best practices for Python project organization

## Next Steps
- Begin Phase 2: Data Pipeline Foundations (storage, BigQuery, Pub/Sub)
- Implement sample data ingestion pipelines
- Create data processing transforms with Apache Beam
- Add data quality validation functions

## Active Decisions
- Focus on core GCP data services: BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Dataflow, Pub/Sub
- Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) for resource provisioning
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
- Follow Google Cloud best practices and Well-Architected Framework

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Use Python for data processing scripts
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Docker for containerized deployments
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
- Clear separation between infrastructure, application, and documentation code

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Memory bank approach ensures consistent project understanding
- Early establishment of project structure prevents future refactoring
- GCP data platform requires careful consideration of data lifecycle management
- Cost optimization should be built into architecture from the beginning
