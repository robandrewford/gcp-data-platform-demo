# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Completed Phase 2: Data Pipeline Foundations. Infrastructure and pipeline templates are ready. Moving to Phase 3 data processing examples.

## Recent Changes

- ✅ Completed Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Phase 2: Data Pipeline Foundations
- ✅ Created comprehensive BigQuery schemas for raw events and transformed data
- ✅ Added specialized Pub/Sub topics for pipeline patterns (alerts, status, batch, streaming)
- ✅ Implemented Dataflow service account with appropriate permissions
- ✅ Built Cloud Storage buckets
- ✅ Created Pub/Sub → BigQuery and Cloud Storage → BigQuery pipeline templates
- ✅ Integrated UV and Ruff for dependency management and code quality
- ✅ Refactored `src/` directory into modular Python packages
- ✅ Updated project documentation with comprehensive README

## Next Steps

- Implement sample data ingestion pipelines using the created templates
- Develop batch processing pipelines for data transformation
- Create streaming data processing pipelines for real-time analytics
- Implement data quality validation functions
- Build basic dashboards for data visualization

## Active Decisions

- Focus on core GCP data services: BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Dataflow, Pub/Sub
- Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) for resource provisioning
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
- Follow Google Cloud best practices and Well-Architected Framework

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Use Python for data processing scripts
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Docker for containerized deployments
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
- Clear separation between infrastructure, application, and documentation code

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Memory bank approach ensures consistent project understanding
- Early establishment of project structure prevents future refactoring
- GCP data platform requires careful consideration of data lifecycle management
- Cost optimization should be built into architecture from the beginning
