# Progress

## What Works

- âœ… Memory bank structure initialized
- âœ… Project brief established
- âœ… Product context defined
- âœ… Active context and next steps outlined
- âœ… System architecture patterns documented
- âœ… Technical stack and constraints defined

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

- [x] Terraform infrastructure configurations for GCP resources
- [x] Multi-environment setup (dev/staging/prod)
- [x] CI/CD pipeline definitions
- [x] Service account and IAM role configurations

### Phase 2: Data Pipeline Foundations

- [x] Basic Cloud Storage bucket setup
- [x] BigQuery dataset and table structures
- [x] Pub/Sub topic configurations
- [x] Dataflow pipeline templates

### Phase 3: Data Processing Examples

- [ ] Sample data ingestion pipeline
- [ ] Batch processing ETL pipeline
- [ ] Streaming data processing pipeline
- [ ] Data quality validation functions

### Phase 4: Analytics and Visualization

- [ ] BigQuery scheduled queries
- [ ] Data transformation SQL scripts
- [ ] Basic dashboard configurations
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup

### Phase 5: Documentation and Examples

- [ ] Comprehensive README and setup guides
- [ ] Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Cost optimization documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides

## Current Status

**Status**: ðŸ“Š Pipeline Foundations Complete - Ready for Examples
**Priority**: Medium - Data processing implementation
**Blockers**: None

## Known Issues

- No blocking issues identified
- Memory bank structure established without conflicts
- All core GCP services available for implementation

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (Current)

- Focus on GCP native services for maximum compatibility
- Python as primary language for data processing
- Terraform for infrastructure management
- GitHub repository for version control and collaboration

### Potential Future Adjustments

- May add support for other cloud providers if requested
- Could include Kubernetes-based deployments for complex scenarios
- Might integrate with additional GCP services based on use cases

## Timeline Expectations

- **Phase 1 (Infrastructure)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Pipeline Foundation)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3 (Processing Examples)**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 4 (Analytics)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 5 (Documentation)**: 1-2 weeks

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Infrastructure deploys successfully across environments
- [ ] Data pipelines process sample data end-to-end
- [ ] Documentation enables new users to understand and contribute
- [ ] Cost monitoring shows predictable resource usage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet expectations
