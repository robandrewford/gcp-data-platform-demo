# Project Brief

## Overview
gcp-data-platform-demo is a demonstration project showcasing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data platform capabilities and best practices.

## Goals
- Demonstrate GCP data platform services and architectures
- Provide reference implementations for common data processing patterns
- Showcase integration between various GCP data services
- Serve as a learning resource for GCP data platform development

## Scope
- Data ingestion and processing pipelines
- Data storage and management solutions
- Data analytics and visualization
- Best practices for GCP data platform design
- Cost optimization and performance considerations

## Success Criteria
- Functional demonstrations of key GCP data services
- Working end-to-end data pipelines
- Clear documentation and code examples
- Performance benchmarks and cost analysis
- Educational value for learning GCP data platforms

## Constraints
- Must use Google Cloud Platform services
- Focus on data platform capabilities (not general application development)
- Should be deployable and runnable in a GCP environment
- Code should follow GCP and cloud best practices
